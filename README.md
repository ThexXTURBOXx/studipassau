</p>

The successor of the app [StudiPassau](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=studip_uni_passau.femtopedia.de.unipassaustudip),
completely rewritten in Dart using Flutter framework.

The app is made for use with Android (and later Fuchsia as well), even though it should be compatible with iOS as well (in theory).

## Compiling from source

The compilation from source should be straight forward (only Android):

1. Fully install the [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
2. Clone this repo using `git clone https://github.com/ThexXTURBOXx/studipassau.git`
3. Create a file called `.env` in the project's root and add your OAuth credentials:
```
CONSUMER_KEY=<YourConsumerKeyHere>
CONSUMER_SECRET=<YourConsumerSecretHere>
```
4. Compile it using Android Studio's `Build->Flutter->Build XXX` feature

If you want to compile the app for iOS, I can't really help you as I usually don't for iOS and have no Apple Developer account :/
